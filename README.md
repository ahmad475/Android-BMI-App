# Android-BMI-App

INTRODUCTION:
In this lab we created an app which calculated your body mass index it also calculated your weight in pounds and displayed both of them. The lab calculated your BMI by dividing your weight by your height squared and it calculated your weight in pounds by multiplying by 2.2( conversion from kilos to pounds). We did this by manipulating it in android studio and adding essential code that aided us in our endeavor

RESULTS:
The results  of our work was that we were able to to calculate the BMI  an the weight in the app that we created on our phone. What was required of us was the fact that we had to create many methods that all collaborated together to allow our project to function properly. We also had to do a fair bit of mathematics in order to succeed in calculating the BMI.

DISCUSSION:
We learned how to use java and android studios to display and work on our app. We also learned how to make methods and classes and how to add method signatures and convert integers to strings.
